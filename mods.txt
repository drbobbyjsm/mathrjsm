									<header><h3>Why care about vector spaces?</h3></header>
									In the first few chapters, we deal with systems of linear equations, and we will see that it's much easier to use matrices to solve them. 
									Applications here are probably more obvious than later in the semester, when we start talking about properties of matrices more generally.
