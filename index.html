				<h2>
					Current Research Interests
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Current research interests include number theory, arithmetic geometry, elliptic curves, and Galois representations.  My thesis, with advisor &Aacutelvaro Lozano-Robledo, focuses on classifying torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over function fields of genus zero and one. Recently, I have become interested in torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over function fields of hyperelliptic curves, and with this, bounding the gonality of certain families of modular curves.

				<p>	 
					Teaching is something I am highly passionate about. I spend time outside of class thinking of new ways to provide my students with the best possible learning experience, and I often seek out the advice of more experienced colleagues to share and improve my pedagogy. In addition to reflecting on my own teaching, I try to recall my experiences as a learner. I remember what it was like to be a student seeing things for the first time. I try to show my students that math belongs to everyone. I humanize myself by warning my students about common misconceptions, and I am open about my own past challenges. </p><p>

Shaped by my past instruction, I recognize the responsibility to provide students with a positive mathematical experience. This is especially important in service courses, which are often terminal courses, where students may have developed a negative attitude toward mathematics. I remember the teachers who were successful in fostering my interest in the material they taught. I incorporate my favorite memories into my own teaching. In my experience, successful teachers made learning enjoyable by doing special examples and applications that were relevant and stimulating. They told stories about their own experiences with mathematics. They showed a genuine love for the craft. In the same spirit, I try to impart a love for mathematics in my students by sharing my joy for teaching, the way my favorite teachers did for me.

											<h3>Family and Home</h3>

										<p>
									 <img style="float:left;width:200px;height:240px;padding-right: 20px" padding src="IMG_2707.jpg"  alt="Me and the fam." /> 
									 Currently, I live in Middletown, CT, with my wife, Kayla, and our newborn son, Andrew, born June 2019. We are absolutely in love with him.
									 We also have a cat, Lemma, who's been with us since I started graduate school. Kayla and I love to travel, and have taken a trip 
									 every year since we met. Most notable was our two-month cross country trip in 2016. We took a very awkward route to California which saw us in
									 Nashville, St. Louis, New Mexico, the Grand Canyon, and Vegas. Our route back was more direct. We loved seeing the Grand Canyon, the redwoods, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and so much more.

									<h3>Experiences in Education</h3>
								</header>
								
							<p>I've been living in Connecticut since I was six years old. I grew up in a small town called Scotland, 
								about 45 minutes east of Hartford, CT. Scotland is a <b>very</b> small town, with a population of about 1700 people. 
								There were 20 students in my class at primary school, and with two other towns, Chaplin and Hampton (with a total population of 
								around 4000 between all three),	I had a high school graduating class of 30 students. Honestly, I loved the experience of a small school 
								and a small community, which is why I ended up going to a small local community college and Eastern Connecticut State University, a small liberal arts college in Willimantic, CT,
								to complete my bachelor's in mathematics. ECSU was by far the best choice for me; they had 5000 undergraduates, and my class sizes were rarely over
								10-15 students. The liberal arts philosophy fostered great 
								relationships between me, my class, and my professors, and I left feeling more well-rounded than I would have with a more pre-professional 
								education at a larger university.</p>
							<p>While finishing up at Eastern, I spent some time working as a metal cutting engineer at Spirol International in Danielson, CT. 
								Tere, I designed side and end-work cutting tools for multispindle lathes. It was very fun, but ultimately,  I decided 
								my true passion was for math research and teaching. That's when I decided to go to the University of Connecticut (a not so small school)
								to pursue my PhD in mathematics, which I received in May of 2019!</p>

											<h3>Some Hobbies</h3>
										</header>
										<img style="float:right;width:200px;height:240px;padding-left: 20px" padding src="toughmudder.jpg"  alt="Tough mudder." /> 
											
									<p>
										I love to hike, bike, and run, though I'm trying to get back into the latter. I'm really into table top RPGs, and may have dabbled 
										a little bit in LARP (don't tell anyone). I'm equally interested in video games, and fill a lot of my "free time" playing new and retro games.
										Finally, I love to sing and play music. I'm in the Vernon Chorale, a small choral ensemble in Vernon, and I'm getting ready to play the saxophone in the 
										Middletown Symphonic Band. I don't think I'm particularly good at either, but it's an amazing outlet. I've run a few half marathons, 
										and one full marathon (where "run" is an operative term). I've also done a rugged maniac, but my all time favorite was the Tough Mudder!
