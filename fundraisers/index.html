							<h1>About Movember</h1>

								<p><h4>Prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and suicide -- men aren't getting help</h4>
								The Movember Foundation was established to raise awareness, and <a href="https://us.movember.com/report-cards/">raise money for men's health</a> through cancer research, prevention, and early intervention with mental illness. Globally almost 10 million men are living with or beyond <a href="https://us.movember.com/about/prostate-cancer">prostate cancer</a>. It is estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 men will develop <a href="https://us.movember.com/about/testicular-cancer">testicular cancer</a> each year. The chance of developing testis cancer is about one in 270, and of those, about 1 in 20 die. In the United States, on average, there are 123 suicides per day, with <a href="https://us.movember.com/about/mental-health">men dying by suicide</a> 3.5 times more often than women. Globally, on average, one man dies by suicide every minute of every hour. For many reasons, pride and masculinity among them, men aren't getting the regular checkups, screenings, and preventative care they need. </p>

								<p><h4>Movember, and what I'm doing to help</h4>

								Throughout the month of November (and possibly longer depending on how much is raised), I will be growing a ridiculous handlebar mustache and mutton chops to spark conversation and raise awareness about men's health, and support the Movember Foundation through donations that I can raise. Thirty seconds before publishing this site, I also decided that I, and my out-of-practice butt, will commit to running/walking <b>one mile for ever five dollars</b> raised in the month of November. We've already raised $100 dollars, so it looks like I need to hit the road tomorrow! Listen guys, I'm not kidding about being out of practice. I haven't run in over a year!

		

								<p> 		
								<h4>What you can do to help</h4>

								Please consider donating. Whether 5 or 500 dollars, whatever you can give to this cause is appreciated, and will be put toward this amazing cause.

								Other than that, the following suggestions are taken from the Movember Foundation website
									<p><h4>GROW A MO, SAVE A BRO</h4>
Your Mo can inspire donations, conversations and real change.
The men’s health crisis calls for big minds, and big solutions. But there’s a smaller, hairier solution to the men’s health crisis. A solution you can Grow yourself. It’s sitting under your nose.

Grow a Mo this Movember, and you can stop men dying too young.</p>



									<p><h4>MAKE YOUR MOVE</h4>
Put one foot in front of the other to raise funds for men’s health.
Move this Movember by running or walking 60 miles over the month. That’s 60 miles for the 60 men we lose to suicide each hour, every hour across the world. You don’t have to be an ultra-athlete, or own the latest kicks. Move is simpler than that. Hit it fast. Take it slow. Run solo. Join a team. Go outside. Call on friends and family to back you with a donation, and then chip away, your way. You can stop men dying too young.</p>

<p><h4>WANT TO BE A MO SISTA?</h4>

	Women can play an important role by heading fundraisers, participating in MOVE-mber, or wearing Movember apparel (or maybe a fake mustache?!). Start the conversation! If you see a guy during the month of November sporting a moustache, walk right up to him and ask him if he is sporting his Mo for Movember. A men’s health conversation is guaranteed to happen as a result of that interaction! </p>
