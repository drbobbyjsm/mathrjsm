<p><b>Offce Hours:</b> Time and location are on <a href="#">the front page</a> (it's best to keep them in one place!). I'll hold hours every week, and you should feel free to drop by to chat about any questions or concerns that you have. You do not need an appointment to come to office hours. </p>
<p><b>Residential College Tutors:</b> Each college has math and science tutors who hold regular office hours.
The schedule can be found at the Center for Teaching and Learning website. Note: You can attend
tutor office hours at any college, not just your own.</p>
<p><b>Study Groups with Peers:</b> You are strongly advised to form study groups with your classmates.
Discussion and collaboration are among the best ways to learn mathematics.</p>

<center><header><h4> General Advice for Success </h4></header></center>
<ul>
<li>Work outside of class! These topics can not be learned in 150 = 75 + 75 minutes each week. On
average, students (not just in our class, but in general) are supposed to spend an average of two
hours outside of class. That would be about six hours per class. That’s why they call it full time!</li>
<li>Make mistakes! Particularly on the homework, you might not know what to try first. Just try
something. The process of mathematics is full of mistakes. I could fill a book with all of the
mistakes I’ve made. They’re an integral part of learning!</li>
<li>Work with your peers. Bouncing ideas off of each other is the best way to learn.</li>
<li>COME TO MY OFFICE HOURS! It’s free tutoring. From your instructor. You know, the one who
writes the exams. Please come, or make an appointment if you can’t!</li>
<li>We’ll be assigned a peer tutor, and when we do, I’ll be sure to post relevant information about
how to access them on our website. This is the best place to go to get someone else’s take on
the material that isn’t me. They might be able to explain something differently. </li>
</ul>
