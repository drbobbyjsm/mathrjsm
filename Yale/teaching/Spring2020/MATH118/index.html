<header><h2>Schedule</h2></header>

<p>Rather than have a set rigid schedule, we'll try to be flexible and give each topic the time it deserves. I will always give you a heads up as to what the next few topics will be, but in most cases you can safely assume we’ll be doing every section from each chapter, roughly in the following order. </p>
<center><h3><u>First half (roughly weeks 1-6)</u> </h3></center>
<p>We will start the semester with Linear algebra, from Strang’s “Introduction to linear algebra”, covering chapters 1-4. You do not need to buy this book, but our topic order will be the same.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 1</b> talks about vectors and matrices, and how they relate to systems of linear equations. <br>
<b>Chapter 2</b> will teach us how to simplify systems of equations, calculate matrix inverses, and factor matrices into simpler ones. This will give us the techniques to solve systems given by invertible matrices, which always have a unique solution. <br>
<b>Chapter 3</b> studies vector spaces, concentrating on those associated with matrices. It will allow us to deal with more complicated systems, recognize when solutions may not exist, and when there might be more than one. <br>
<b>Chapter 4</b> works with systems that do not have a solution: we will learn how to find the “best answer”, one that does not fit the equations exactly, but it is as close as possible.
<div style=" border: 2px solid black; padding-left:10px; padding-left:10px"><b>Midterm 1</b> will cover all of the linear algebra we’ve learned. The expected date of this exam is Tuesday, February 25, in class. Really, we'll take it after we finish chapter 4, which is expected around week 7.</div>
</p>


<center><h3><u>Second half (roughly weeks 8, 11-15)</u></h3></center>
<p>Using what we have learned about matrices. We will cover chapters 12-15 in McCallum’s “Calculus, Multivariable”. You do not need to buy this book, but our topic order will be the same.</p> 
<p><b>Chapter 12</b> introduces functions of multiple variables. We will talk about equations of surfaces, draw cross-sections and topographical maps. <br>
<b>Chapter 13</b> is a review of linear algebra: we will add only the cross product from here, which will allow us to write equations of planes in three dimensions. <br>
<b>Chapter 14</b> is about derivatives. We will learn how to calculate x and y derivatives, as well as derivatives in other directions (for example along y = x). The techniques are very similar to those of single variable calculus. Tangent lines to curves will be replaced by tangent planes to surfaces, and we will have three different kinds of second order derivatives instead of one; but everything in this chapter should feel familiar.
<div style=" border: 2px solid black; padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px"><b>Midterm 2:</b> the second exam (not cumulative) will cover the multivariable calculus we’ve learned up through Chapter 14. The expected date of this exam is Tuesday, April 8, in class. Again, we'll really take it after we finish chapter 14, which you should expect around week 13.</div><br>
<b>Chapter 15</b> is about optimization, and finding minima and maxima of multivariable functions. Once again, the material will be quite familiar from single variable calculus, though the second derivative test will be more complicated, as will be the checking of “endpoints” (which will now be entire boundary curves of the region in question). Lastly, we will cover optimization subject to a constraint, using a technique known as Lagrange multipliers.</p>
